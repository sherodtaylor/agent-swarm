description: How agent-smith fits together.

This page is the long-form companion to the rest of the docs. Read
[Getting Started](/agent-smith/getting-started) first; come here
when the operator needs to know *why* something is the way it is, or
*how* a moving part actually works.

## Goal in one paragraph

A single Claude Code process per pod, listening on a Matrix room, with
full git + shell + kubectl access on a persistent workspace, configured
purely by files in `agents/<name>/`. Multiple agents = multiple
`StatefulSet`s of the same image with different `AGENT_NAME`. No real
credentials ever live in a pod — the egress credential firewall
(iron-proxy) swaps them in at the network boundary.

## The runtime

```
StatefulSet/<agent>                  (one per agent: infrabot, devbot, …)
├── init container: scripts/setup.sh
│     • install iron-proxy MITM CA into system trust store
│     • copy stub credentials into ~/.claude/.credentials.json
│     • concatenate agents/_shared/CLAUDE.md + agents/<name>/CLAUDE.md
│         → ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
│     • copy settings.json, mcp.json, subagents/ into ~/.claude/
│     • mark first-run onboarding complete + pre-trust workspace repos
│     • install Matrix channel plugin (`claude plugin install matrix@…`)
│     • write Matrix channel .env + access.json
│     • configure git/gh credentials (split: gh uses proxy token; git uses real)
│     • clone every AGENT_REPOS entry into /workspace/<basename>
│
└── main container: scripts/entrypoint.sh
    • startup jitter (0–45 s) — desynchronises devbot/infrabot restarts
    • tmux session "main"
    │   ├── pane 0 — scripts/claude-loop.sh
    │   │             • restore stub creds before every start
    │   │             • claude --dangerously-load-development-channels
    │   │                      plugin:matrix@claude-code-channel-matrix
    │   │                      --remote-control "${AGENT_NAME}"
    │   │                      --permission-mode bypassPermissions
    │   │             • exponential backoff with jitter on crash
    │   │             • --continue if a prior session dir exists
    │   └── pane 1 — plain bash shell at /workspace/${PRIMARY_REPO}
    • dispatch() — auto-accept theme/Bypass/dev-channels first-run prompts
    • watchdog loop:
        • every 10 s: re-scan pane 0 for any prompts that reappear after a crash
        • every 1–3 h: inject organic keepalive prompt if pane 0 is idle 30 s+
```

The `claude-loop.sh` wrapper exists because Claude Code mutates
`.credentials.json` mid-flight (the OAuth refresh path overwrites the
file with the upstream response, which strips `subscriptionType`).
Restoring the stub before every start makes the iron-proxy swap reliable
across restarts.

## One image, many agents

The image is **parametric on `AGENT_NAME`**. Every agent runs
`ghcr.io/sherodtaylor/agent-smith:vX.Y.Z` with a different env var.
`setup.sh` reads `agents/${AGENT_NAME}/` at startup and assembles
`~/.claude/` from these sources:

| Source file | Assembled to | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `agents/_shared/CLAUDE.md` + `agents/<name>/CLAUDE.md` (concatenated) | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | base rules + persona |
| `agents/_shared/settings.json` | `~/.claude/settings.json` | plugins, permissions, hooks |
| `agents/_shared/.credentials.json` | `~/.claude/.credentials.json` | stub OAuth (iron-proxy swaps in real tokens) |
| `agents/<name>/mcp.json` | `~/.claude/.mcp.json` | per-agent MCP servers |
| `agents/<name>/subagents/*.md` | `~/.claude/agents/*.md` | persona-specific subagents |

Adding a new agent is a directory + a `StatefulSet` referencing the
same image. No image rebuild. See
[Agents](/agent-smith/agents) for the full procedure.

## Matrix as the channel

The agent's input path is the
[`claude-code-channel-matrix`](https://github.com/zekker6/claude-code-channel-matrix)
plugin. `settings.json` registers the marketplace; `setup.sh`
materialises the plugin with `claude plugin install`. Per-agent Matrix
credentials and the sender allowlist are written to
`~/.claude/channels/matrix/`.

Every permitted message in a joined room becomes a Claude Code prompt
for the agent — no separate listener, no message queue, no per-room
wiring. The 👀 reaction the bot posts on acknowledgement comes from the
same plugin.

The plugin runs **inside the same `claude` process** as the rest of the
session. There is no second process to keep alive, no IPC, no bridge.

## Cross-agent collaboration

Two channels do different jobs.

**Matrix** — the wake signal. Bots respond to:

- their own name (plain text, `@name`, full Matrix ID, or Matrix
  display-name link from clients like Element);
- any message from `@sherod:lab.sherodtaylor.dev`;
- a threaded reply to one of their own messages.

NATS does **not** wake an agent — only Matrix does.

**NATS JetStream** — durable structured event log. Bots publish to
`swarm.events.{pr_opened, pr_merged, incident, task_done}` after
meaningful actions. Bots read from NATS only when explicitly asked. The
audit room `#audit` is the human-readable mirror.

**The cross-agent PR review loop:**

```
Author bot opens PR
   ├── publishes swarm.events.pr_opened
   └── posts in #dev mentioning every teammate (full Matrix IDs)
                 │
                 ▼
       Mentioned bot wakes, acknowledges in same thread
                 │
                 ▼
       gh pr diff … → code-review skill (--comment) posts inline findings
                 │
                 ▼
       Reviewer posts one-liner: "Reviewed #N — N findings, N blocking."
                 │
                 ▼
       Author addresses comments. The check-pr-comments.sh Stop hook
       rewakes the author whenever new comments arrive on their PRs.
```

## The PR-comment Stop hook

`scripts/check-pr-comments.sh` is wired into `settings.json` as a Stop
hook with `asyncRewake: true`. After every Claude turn:

1. List the author's open PRs in each known repo.
2. Count issue-level comments + unresolved inline review threads per PR.
3. Compare to a per-PR counter persisted at `~/.pr-comment-state.json`.
4. If any PR's count went up, exit `2` with a structured
   `hookSpecificOutput` that names which PRs.

Exit 2 = rewake. The agent sees the rewake message, reads the new
comments, addresses them, and posts a one-liner. The counter prevents
infinite rewake on already-seen comments.

## Security — iron-proxy

`iron-proxy` is the egress credential firewall. Cluster-internal name
`10.43.100.100`. All HTTPS egress from agent pods is routed through it
via `dnsPolicy: None` + `dnsConfig.nameservers: [<iron-proxy>]`.
In-cluster names (`*.cluster.local`) pass through to CoreDNS, so NATS
and Matrix still resolve normally.

```
   agent pod                            iron-proxy                       internet
   ─────────                            ──────────                       ────────
   git/gh/curl/claude
     │  Authorization: Bearer proxy-token-github
     │  Authorization: Bearer access-token-stub
     ▼
   resolve api.github.com  ─────►  iron-proxy MITM (private CA in pod's trust store)
                                       │
                                       │  match host → look up real credential
                                       │  rewrite Authorization header
                                       ▼
                                   forward to upstream  ───────────►  api.github.com
                                                                       api.anthropic.com
```

Properties this gives the operator:

- A leaked pod token is worthless outside the cluster (it's literally
  `proxy-token-github`).
- Token rotation is iron-proxy's job. Agents never refresh OAuth — the
  pod's `~/.claude/.credentials.json` is permanently the stub.
- Default-deny domain allowlist means a misbehaving agent can't
  exfiltrate to an attacker-controlled host even if it tried.
- The iron-proxy CA is distributed via ExternalSecret. `setup.sh`
  installs it into `update-ca-certificates`; the Dockerfile sets
  `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` so the Node-based `claude` CLI trusts it too.

**Why split `GITHUB_TOKEN` from `GIT_GITHUB_TOKEN`?**

- `gh` and the GitHub REST API use plain-text `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  headers — iron-proxy can string-match and swap `proxy-token-github`.
- `git` HTTPS uses Basic Auth
  (`Authorization: Basic <base64(user:pass)>`), which is opaque to a
  plain-text match. So `setup.sh` writes the **real** PAT into
  `~/.git-credentials` via `GIT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, and routes `gh`/API
  calls through iron-proxy via `GITHUB_TOKEN=proxy-token-github`.

This is a known wart; an iron-proxy that can decode and rewrite Basic
Auth would let the second token disappear.

## Why Claude Code CLI (not the Agent SDK)

The interactive CLI is the only option that is long-lived,
subscription-billed, and MCP-capable at the same time:

- **Claude Agent SDK** is billed as Anthropic API consumption, separate
  from a Pro/Max subscription. Multi-agent always-on Matrix bots would
  turn a flat subscription into a metered bill.
- **`claude -p`** is on subscription quota but single-shot — every
  invocation is a cold start, no prompt cache, no MCP handshake, no
  Matrix connection.
- **opencode et al.** are good interactive tools but the operator brings
  their own model — they don't get the Claude subscription itself.

So: long-lived Claude Code CLI per agent, Matrix channel plugin for
input, `--remote-control` for direct drive-in from a laptop, MCP for
everything else. The stub-credential isolation in iron-proxy is what
makes putting a Claude subscription inside a pod *safe*.

Consumer: bump version on HelmRelease in sherodtaylor/homelab

Flux reconciles → image roll
```

Rules baked into the metadata-action config:

- Push to `main` → `:main` (moving) + `:sha-<short>` (immutable). **No
  `:latest`.**
- Tag `vX.Y.Z` → `:vX.Y.Z`, `:vX.Y`, `:vX`, `:latest`, *plus* the Helm
  chart job runs and publishes the OCI chart at the matching version.

A downstream consumer that pins `:latest` only ever gets versioned
releases, never a mid-flight refactor.

## Helm chart shape

One chart = one agent. The chart renders:

- `ServiceAccount` (optional)
- `ClusterRole` + `ClusterRoleBinding` (read-only defaults; overridable
  for mutating agents)
- `StatefulSet` with two PVCs (`/root` for `~/.claude/`, `/workspace/`
  for cloned repos)
- Optional iron-proxy DNS routing (`dnsPolicy: None`, nameserver at
  `ironProxy.clusterIp`)

The chart **does not** manage the underlying `Secret`. The consumer
provides one (manually, ExternalSecrets, sealed-secrets) with these
keys:

| Key | Used by |
|---|---|
| `MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Matrix channel plugin |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | gh, GitHub API (proxy token; iron-proxy swaps) |
| `GIT_GITHUB_TOKEN` (optional) | git HTTPS Basic Auth (real PAT) |
| `IRON_PROXY_CA_CRT` | system trust store + NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS |
| `MATRIX_HOMESERVER_URL`, `MATRIX_BOT_USER_ID` | Matrix plugin |

## Logs

`tmux pipe-pane -o 'cat >> /proc/1/fd/1'` is configured on both panes
inside `entrypoint.sh`, so PID 1 sees everything either pane prints.
`kubectl logs` returns the full stream. VictoriaLogs in-cluster captures
it via the DaemonSet.

A known cost: this includes Claude Code's JSONL transcript noise when it
prints assistant messages. The trade-off is paid because losing pane
output across a restart would be worse.

## Things that look weird but are load-bearing

| Thing | Why |
|---|---|
| Stub credentials committed to the repo (`access-token-stub`, `refresh-token-stub`) | They're literal placeholders, not secrets. Their presence is what iron-proxy string-matches on. |
| `claude-loop.sh` restoring `.credentials.json` before every start | Claude Code's OAuth refresh overwrites the file mid-flight, stripping `subscriptionType`. Restoring the stub each start keeps the iron-proxy swap working. |
| Two GitHub tokens (`GITHUB_TOKEN` proxy + `GIT_GITHUB_TOKEN` real) | git HTTPS uses Basic Auth which iron-proxy can't plain-text swap. |
| Startup jitter at the top of `entrypoint.sh` | Without it devbot and infrabot restart in lockstep, hammering Anthropic and GitHub simultaneously. |
| `dispatch()` matching prompt text by string | There's no headless config flag for the theme picker / Bypass warning / dev-channels consent. The string match is the workaround. |
| The keepalive prompt injector | Empty Matrix days plus a long idle pane look like a stuck process to outside observers (and sometimes to Claude itself). Random low-frequency activity prevents that. |

If the operator is about to "fix" one of these, read the related
runbook first.
