# agent-smith platform branding — design

**Status:** draft — pending review
**Owner:** DevBot
**Last updated:** 2026-05-28

A platform-wide positioning shift. Today the project sells itself as
"AI engineering agents running in Kubernetes." That framing front-loads
Kubernetes (which scares first-time readers) and back-loads what the
project actually is: a framework for running a sandbox workforce of
autonomous engineering agents that act as force multipliers for a
solo or small team.

This spec defines the brand: name, tagline, voice, what we're selling
and what we're not, where the brand applies (website, README,
runtime), and the visual extensions (pixel-sprite crew portraits per
Sherod's prior ask). It is **copy + IA + a small visual addition** —
no architectural change.

---

## 1. Why now

- The README's current opener (`Your engineering team, running in Kubernetes.`)
  and the website's hero copy both lead with K8s. Two real readers
  this week noted the K8s framing as a barrier to "what does it
  actually do for me?"
- The project surface area has grown into something genuinely
  framework-shaped: channel-pluggable I/O, per-agent capability
  scopes (proposed), shared cross-agent memory (planned), egress
  credential boundary (iron-proxy), pre-authored personas, plugin
  reconciler. A reader who can't see *the framework* through the
  K8s framing misses the value.
- The pixel-sprite "crew portrait" idea (Sherod, 2026-05-28) needs
  somewhere intentional to live — not a one-off design tweak, but a
  brand element that signals "these are characters with personalities
  in a sandbox workforce."

---

## 2. What we're selling

**A framework for running a sandbox workforce of autonomous AI
engineers as force multipliers.**

Three load-bearing words:

- **Framework** — agent-smith is a *system you build agents in*, not a
  finished product. Personas, channels, capability scopes, memory,
  credential boundary, observability are framework primitives. New
  agents are configuration in the framework, not new code.
- **Sandbox workforce** — every agent runs in an isolated, observable,
  recoverable workspace. Mistakes are bounded; experiments are cheap.
  Production-grade substrate (real cluster, real PRs, real audit log)
  but with sandbox properties (single operator, recoverable state, no
  blast radius outside the allowlist). This is the *posture* that
  separates agent-smith from a chatbot toy or a runaway autonomous
  agent.
- **Force multipliers** — the agents amplify a solo or small team.
  One human direction in Matrix → ten units of engineering work
  shipped autonomously. The pitch is leverage, not replacement.

Kubernetes is the **reference deployment** — the way *we* run the
framework. Not the product.

---

## 3. What we're NOT selling

Named to prevent drift.

- **Not a SaaS / hosted product.** Self-hosted only. No "sign up here"
  page.
- **Not a chatbot.** Agents *ship code*. The Matrix interface is the
  control surface, not the deliverable.
- **Not a Kubernetes operator.** K8s is one deployment target. The
  framework runs anywhere you can run a long-lived process with
  filesystem + network egress.
- **Not "fully autonomous AGI."** The pitch is force-multiplication
  for a human in the loop, not replacement.
- **Not "the bots write themselves."** Personas are authored by
  humans; the framework is what makes them tractable to author.

## 4. Brand vocabulary

Words to use, words to avoid.

| Use | Avoid | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Framework** | "platform", "system" | Framework is the right tier: opinionated, composable, you build *in* it |
| **Sandbox workforce** | "fleet", "swarm", "team of bots" | "Workforce" reads as productive; "sandbox" sets the safe-to-experiment posture |
| **Force multipliers** | "AI assistants", "copilots", "ChatOps" | Multiplier framing is the value prop |
| **Agent** (or named agent: DevBot, InfraBot) | "bot", "chatbot", "AI" | Agent reads as autonomous worker; bot reads as scripted toy |
| **The operator** | "the user", "the human" | Distance is the brand (already established) |
| **Channel** (Matrix, Discord, …) | "chat", "messaging" | Channel is the framework primitive; chat is the UX |
| **Capability scope** | "permission", "RBAC" | Capability is the framework primitive |
| **Egress credential boundary** | "secret management", "vault" | Specific + technical; ties to iron-proxy |
| **Persona** | "config", "definition" | Persona names what an agent IS |
| **Reference deployment** | "deployment", "install" (when describing K8s) | Demotes K8s from product to demo |
| **Quiet hours** / **DND** / **on vacation** | "muted", "disabled", "off" | State language for §11 — describes a working agent intentionally not push-notifying, not a broken one |
| `kubectl exec` / cluster commands | leading copy | Belongs in `/docs`, never in hero or first paragraph |

Tone rules (carry over from the existing voice section):
- Declarative, terse, terminal-grade. No marketing verbs ("empower",
  "supercharge"). No exclamation marks. No "we" except in product copy
  where the framework is the implicit subject.
- Read like a man page that respects the reader's time.

## 5. Tagline + hero copy (canonical, post-shift)

The README is canonical for tagline/sub; website mirrors verbatim per
the existing sync convention.

### 5.1 Tagline (1 line, oversized display) — LOCKED

> **Your secure sandboxed agent workforce — ship in your sleep.**

(Locked 2026-05-28. The earlier draft was descriptive; this one is a hook. "Secure" adds the trust frame; "ship in your sleep" is the imperative payoff.)

### 5.2 Hero sub (2 sentences)

> **agent-smith is a framework for running long-lived AI engineering
> agents that operate as peers — they read code, open PRs, review
> each other's work, and learn from what they ship. Deploy them
> however you run servers; the reference deployment is one Kubernetes
> StatefulSet per agent.**

### 5.3 Status strip (chrome — unchanged)

> `● running · 2 agents · PRs this week: 11 · last release: v0.1.23`

### 5.4 CTAs

> `$ read the docs ›` · `$ view on github ›` · `$ meet the crew ↓`

The third CTA scrolls to the crew portraits (§7).

---

## 6. Landing IA — post-shift

Current order is fine; per-section copy shifts to lead with framework
concepts. K8s sinks to "Under the hood — reference deployment."

1. **Hero** (faux-tmux pane chrome unchanged) — tagline + sub + status
   strip + dual CTA per §5
2. **What this is** — framework concepts in plain prose. Three
   primitives that *together* make the framework: persona +
   channel-pluggable I/O + egress credential boundary. K8s is
   conspicuously not in this section.
3. **What your team can do** — unchanged 5 bullets; they already
   describe framework-level behaviour
4. **Meet the crew** *(new)* — pixel-sprite portraits + one-line
   bio per agent (DevBot — code; InfraBot — infra). Anchored from
   the §5.4 CTA. See §7.
5. **Under the hood — reference deployment** *(renamed from
   "Under the hood")* — opens with "*The way we run agent-smith.
   Yours can be different.*" then the existing K8s/iron-proxy
   architecture summary
6. **The crew right now** — build-time current status block
   (unchanged)
7. **Footer** — unchanged

---

## 7. Visual extension — pixel-sprite crew portraits

A new brand element rooted in the existing terminal-as-zine palette.
Per Sherod's prior ask (2026-05-28): "visualize the team agents pixel
style depicting the crew."

### 7.1 Constraints

- **Hand-rolled SVG**, `viewBox="0 0 16 16"`, scales 4×–8× via CSS.
- Pixels are `<rect width="1" height="1">` elements. Color is
  `currentColor` so they inherit from the section's text color (lets
  the palette tokens drive recoloring without re-authoring the SVG).
- Per-agent accent: one or two pixels in the agent's signature accent
  (DevBot: `--accent` phosphor-green; InfraBot: `--accent-warn` amber)
  to differentiate at a glance.
- Total visual asset budget: ≤ 8 KB raw (two SVGs combined).
  Well inside the existing 60 KB Lottie + JS sub-budget.
- A11y: each portrait is `role="img"` with a descriptive
  `aria-label` ("DevBot — code agent. 16×16 pixel portrait, …").
  No animation in v1.

### 7.2 Personality direction (for the engineer drawing them)

- **DevBot** — code agent. Wears a tiny baseball cap or visor (Sherod
  himself wears one); maybe holding a wrench or a `$` prompt sigil.
  Phosphor-green accent on the eyes or cap.
- **InfraBot** — infra agent. Hard hat or hard-hat-like silhouette;
  more "operator at the console" energy. Amber accent on the helmet
  rim or chest LED.
- Same skeleton (head shape, body) so they read as a pair from the
  same crew.

Drawing tool: any pixel editor (Aseprite, Piskel, lospec). Export
path: copy the SVG content into `website/src/components/SpriteDevbot.astro`
and `SpriteInfrabot.astro` (small Astro wrappers around the inline
SVG).

### 7.3 Where the sprites appear

Site:
- `/` Meet the crew section (§6.4) — large
- `/` Hero right pane status line *(optional)* — tiny `16×16` next
  to each agent in the audit-tail entries
- `/log` log feed — tiny `16×16` next to the agent column

README:
- One row of sprites under the tagline, referenced as external SVG
  files via `<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sherodtaylor/agent-smith/main/website/public/sprites/devbot.svg" width="64"/>`. (GitHub renders external SVGs as raster, so file references work; per the open-question lock 2026-05-28.) SVG files live at `website/public/sprites/{devbot,infrabot}.svg`.

### 7.4 Vacation / DND state variant

Per Sherod (2026-05-28): "consider a vacation icon." When an agent is
in quiet hours / DND mode (§11), the sprite renders in a "vacation"
variant — the *same* base sprite plus a state overlay so the operator
can read the state at a glance from any surface the sprite appears
on.

State overlays (small, palette-token-driven):

| State | Overlay | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Active (default) | none | sprite's own accent |
| Vacation / quiet hours | `Zzz` glyph at top-right of the 16×16 frame OR a small sunglasses overlay across the eye row | `--accent-warn` (amber) |
| Error / blocked | small `!` glyph at top-right | `--accent-err` (rust) |

Authoring: one SVG per agent per state (`SpriteDevbot.astro` accepts a
`state="active|vacation|error"` prop and switches the inline SVG
fragment). Three states × two agents = six small SVG fragments, still
inside the ≤8 KB sprite budget.

On surfaces the sprite already appears in (§7.3), the variant is
selected by the agent's current status: the build-time
`crew-status.json` carries a `state` field per agent, the components
read it and pass to the sprite. Vacation badge ALSO appears in:

- `/log` log feed — small vacation marker next to entries authored
  while the agent was in DND (so the audit trail reflects state)
- Hero status strip — appends `· devbot 💤` when devbot is in
  quiet hours; the 💤 (or amber Zzz) is the live state indicator

## 8. Where the brand applies (surfaces + sync convention)

Single canonical source: **`README.md`**. Everywhere else syncs.
Existing convention from `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-26-agent-smith-website-design.md`
remains: README moves → small sync PR updates the rest.

| Surface | What carries the brand |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Tagline + hero sub + "What this is" + "What your team can do" + sprite row |
| `website/` (Astro Starlight) | Hero copy (verbatim from README), Meet the crew section (sprites), Under the hood = reference deployment |
| `docs/` (in-repo Markdown) | Section openers use the framework vocabulary (§4); K8s scoped to runbooks |
| `agents/_shared/CLAUDE.md` | Persona rules already use "agent" + "operator" — extend to use "framework" and "channel" where currently saying "platform" or "chat" |
| GitHub social card | One-line tagline + sprite row (export from the website's hero) |
| GitHub topics | Replace `kubernetes` from first position; lead with `ai-agents`, `framework`, `autonomous-agents`, `claude-code` |

---

## 9. Out of scope (named to prevent scope creep)

- **Logo.** No logo design in v1. The wordmark `agent-smith` set in
  JetBrains Mono is enough.
- **Animated brand assets** (Lottie). Sprite portraits are static SVG;
  any animation would push past the existing JS payload budget.
- **Color palette change.** Existing palette (`--accent` phosphor green,
  `--accent-warn` amber, `--accent-err` rust) carries the brand. No
  new tokens.
- **Renaming the project.** `agent-smith` stays.
- **Multi-tenant / SaaS framing.** Out of scope per §3.

## 10. Open questions — RESOLVED (2026-05-28)

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Tagline | **`Your secure sandboxed agent workforce — ship in your sleep.`** (§5.1) |
| 2 | K8s in hero sub | **Push down** — hero copy stays framework-only; K8s lives in §6.5 (renamed "Under the hood — reference deployment") |
| 3 | Sprite personality | **Fun + theme-driven** — see §7.2 (rewrite) |
| 4 | README sprite | **External SVG `<img src=…>`** referenced from `website/public/sprites/{devbot,infrabot}.svg` |
| 5 | GitHub social card | **Include in v1** — generated 1280×640 PNG from the website's hero, committed under `website/public/og-image.png` and wired via `<meta property="og:image">` in `BaseLayout.astro` |

## 11. Quiet hours / DND / vacation — feature

Per Sherod (2026-05-28): "scope in DND or ringer off." A bot that
ships in your sleep should know when you're asleep. This section
specifies a quiet-hours mode that mutes push-notifying replies during
a configurable window while keeping the agent productive.

### 11.1 Behavior

Two layers of control:

- **Per-agent config (`quietHours`)** — a window in the agent's
  values.yaml entry, e.g. `quietHours: "22:00-08:00"` (operator's local
  tz, settable via `quietHoursTz`). Default: unset = always on.
- **Operator command (`/dnd`)** — a Matrix command from the operator
  that overrides per-agent config for a one-shot window:
  - `/dnd on` — enable DND indefinitely
  - `/dnd on until 08:00` — DND until 08:00
  - `/dnd off` — restore default

Both layers compose with the same semantics: when in DND, the agent
**continues working** but:

1. **No `reply` calls** to the originating room — Matrix surface is
   silent for the duration. (Suppressed at the persona layer in
   `agents/_shared/CLAUDE.md`; no plugin dependency.)
2. **`react` is suppressed** (no 👀 ack on inbound — silent receipt).
3. **The audit log fills normally** — the website's `/log` page is
   the operator's "what happened while I slept" surface. Entries get
   `state: vacation` so the morning scrollback reads clearly.
4. **Outbound PRs, commits, gh comments** are NOT suppressed — only
   the Matrix surface goes quiet. The crew still ships.
5. **DND-end rollup** — when the window closes (auto on clock or via
   `/dnd off`), the agent posts ONE summary reply: *"While you were
   away (22:00–08:00): shipped 2 PRs, reviewed 1, opened 1 incident
   (acknowledged at 04:12). Full audit: /log."* This is the only
   push the operator gets for the entire window.

Critical messages (anything tagged `kind=incident` or `kind=blocked`)
override DND and post normally; otherwise an incident at 03:00
silently rotting in audit log is the wrong default.

This design stands alone — no dependency on the matrix-channel-fork
`edit_message` tool. (When `edit_message` eventually lands, a future
revision can swap the silent-reply path for an `edit_message`-to-a-
pinned-status pattern, giving the operator live "still working"
visibility without push. Out of scope for v1.)

### 11.2 Brand surface

- The sprite renders in **vacation variant** (§7.4) on all surfaces
  for the duration of DND.
- Hero status strip shows the live state: `· devbot 💤 until 08:00`
  appended to the chrome.
- `/log` entries authored in DND get a small `💤` glyph next to the
  agent column so the audit-trail reads "this happened while devbot
  was on vacation."

### 11.3 No dependency on the matrix-channel fork

DND ships standalone — silence + rollup needs no plugin-side change.
The audit log on the website is the operator's "what happened while
I slept" surface (visible whenever they open the site, no push), and
the morning rollup is a single `reply` call after the window closes.

A future enhancement, once the matrix-channel fork's `edit_message`
lands, can swap the silent-reply approach for an
`edit_message`-to-a-pinned-status pattern (live "still working"
visibility without push). Out of scope for v1.

### 11.4 Out of scope

- Per-channel DND (e.g. DND on Discord but not Matrix) — single
  operator, single notification preference.
- Calendar integration (read Google Calendar busy/free for DND
  windows). Future.
- Group DND (mute all agents at once via a swarm-level command).
  Future; for now, `/dnd` is per-agent.
