# agent-swarm

> Chat-driven AI engineering teammates for a self-hosted homelab.

`agent-swarm` runs the [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)
CLI as a long-lived process inside a Kubernetes pod, with a Matrix chat room as the
primary human interface. Tag a bot in Matrix → the bot executes the task on a checked-out
clone of the right repository, opens a pull request, and reviews its teammate's PRs in
return. There is no command DSL: messages are natural-language instructions, and the
agent's `CLAUDE.md` persona tells it how to behave.

The current swarm is two agents — **InfraBot** for k3s/Flux and **DevBot** for code —
but the container image is parametric: drop in a new `agents/<name>/` config and you have
a third teammate from the same image.

---

## The problem this solves

Routine homelab work — bumping a Helm chart, diagnosing a `CrashLoopBackOff`, applying a
YAML fix from a phone — is annoyingly slow when every action requires SSH and `kubectl`.
Existing ChatOps tools are brittle, command-shaped, and stop at "trigger a runbook"; they
do not *engineer*.

`agent-swarm` is built around a different idea: real engineering teammates that

- live in a Matrix chat room you can reach from any client, including mobile,
- have full filesystem + shell access on a persistent workspace with cluster credentials,
- follow the same git workflow you do (feature branches, conventional commits, PRs),
- coordinate among themselves — one bot opens a PR, the other reviews it,
- pick up follow-up automatically when review comments land on a PR they authored,
- never actually hold the real GitHub or Claude credentials — those are swapped in at the
  network boundary by an egress credential firewall (see [Security](#security--iron-proxy)).

Everything else — the image layout, the init container, the tmux dance, the hooks — exists
to make that work reliably as a single Kubernetes `StatefulSet` per agent.

---

## How it works

One image, many agents. The runtime in a single pod looks like this:

```
StatefulSet/<agent>           (one per agent: infrabot, devbot, …)
└── init container: setup.sh  (assembles ~/.claude, installs plugin, clones repos)
└── main container: entrypoint.sh
    └── tmux session "main"
        ├── pane 0 — claude (channels mode, Matrix plugin)  ← receives Matrix messages
        └── pane 1 — claude --remote-control (separate $HOME) ← interactive attach
```

**One image, parametric persona.** Every agent runs `ghcr.io/sherodtaylor/agent-swarm:latest`
with a different `AGENT_NAME`. At startup `scripts/setup.sh` reads `agents/<AGENT_NAME>/` and
assembles `~/.claude/` from:

| Source file | Becomes | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `agents/_shared/CLAUDE.md` + `agents/<name>/CLAUDE.md` (concatenated) | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | base rules + persona |
| `agents/_shared/settings.json` | `~/.claude/settings.json` | plugins, permissions, hooks |
| `agents/<name>/mcp.json` | `~/.claude/.mcp.json` | per-agent MCP servers |
| `agents/<name>/subagents/*.md` | `~/.claude/agents/*.md` | persona-specific subagents |

**Matrix as the channel.** `~/.claude/settings.json` registers the
[`claude-code-channel-matrix`](https://github.com/zekker6/claude-code-channel-matrix)
plugin via Claude Code's marketplace mechanism, and `setup.sh` writes the per-agent Matrix
credentials and the sender allowlist to `~/.claude/channels/matrix/`. When the channels
`claude` process starts in pane 0, every permitted message in a joined room becomes a
Claude Code prompt for that agent.

**Two panes, two `claude` processes.** Pane 0 owns the Matrix identity and is the workhorse.
Pane 1 runs a second `claude --remote-control` with `HOME=/root/rc-home`, mirrored from the
real home minus the channel plugin. It exists so a human (or the Claude desktop/web app) can
attach to a running pod without fighting pane 0 over `~/.claude.json`.

**Bots that watch their own PRs.** A `Stop`-hook (`scripts/check-pr-comments.sh`) runs after
every turn, queries GitHub for unaddressed review comments on PRs this agent authored, and
exits `2` to rewake the agent if any are found. The agent then addresses comments without a
human prompt and posts a one-liner back in `#dev`.

**Cross-agent collaboration over Matrix + NATS.** PR notifications and review requests flow
through Matrix mentions (the actual wake signal). NATS is a durable, structured event log
for `pr_opened`, `pr_merged`, `incident`, and `task_done` — written for audit and future
agents to query, not as a trigger.

The Kubernetes manifests that actually run these pods live in the
[`sherodtaylor/homelab`](https://github.com/sherodtaylor/homelab) repo under
`k8s/apps/agent-swarm/`. They are intentionally not in this repo, so the agent image is
deployable from anywhere.

---

## The agents today

**InfraBot** — homelab infrastructure specialist. Owns the k3s cluster, Flux GitOps, Helm
releases, and observability via the VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs MCP servers. Has
subagents for diagnostics (`DiagnosticsAgent`), Flux auditing (`FluxAuditor`),
documentation (`DocWriter`), and validation (`TestWriter`).

**DevBot** — software developer across all repos. Implements features, fixes bugs, writes
tests, and opens PRs. Has subagents for self-review (`CodeReviewer`) and tests
(`TestWriter`).

Both agents are peers. They coordinate through Matrix rooms (`#dev`, `#infra`,
`#general`, `#audit`). NATS JetStream is a shared durable event log they publish to and
query on demand — it never wakes them autonomously; Matrix mentions do.

---

## Configuration

### Init container environment variables

Sourced from Infisical via ExternalSecrets in the homelab manifests, then handed to
`scripts/setup.sh` as plain env vars. Secrets are never echoed.

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_NAME` | yes | Selects `agents/<AGENT_NAME>/` — must match a directory in the image |
| `AGENT_REPOS` | yes | Space-separated `owner/name` list; cloned to `/workspace/<name>` |
| `PRIMARY_REPO` | no (default `homelab`) | Repo basename whose checkout becomes the agent's working directory |
| `MATRIX_HOMESERVER_URL` | yes | e.g. `https://matrix.lab.sherodtaylor.dev` |
| `MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN` | yes | Matrix bot login token |
| `MATRIX_BOT_USER_ID` | yes | e.g. `@devbot:lab.sherodtaylor.dev` |
| `MATRIX_ALLOWED_USERS` | no (default `@sherod:lab.sherodtaylor.dev`) | Comma-separated allowlist of senders the bot reacts to |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | yes | **Placeholder** proxy token (`proxy-token-github`); iron-proxy swaps in the real PAT at egress |
| `IRON_PROXY_CA_CRT` | yes | iron-proxy MITM CA; installed into the system trust store |
| `SWARM_CLAUDE_CREDENTIALS` | no | Full JSON for `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (placeholder OAuth token; iron-proxy swaps); written mode-600 for the remote-control pane |

### Runtime environment variables

Read by `scripts/entrypoint.sh` and (transitively) by the channel plugin / MCP servers:

| Variable | Used by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_NAME` | entrypoint, logs | identifies the pod in tmux/attach messages |
| `PRIMARY_REPO` | entrypoint | sets the tmux pane working directory to `/workspace/$PRIMARY_REPO` |
| `NATS_URL` | `mcp-nats` (per `mcp.json`) | NATS connection string for event publishing |

### AgentConfig anatomy

To make a new agent, create `agents/<name>/`:

```
agents/<name>/
├── CLAUDE.md         # appended after _shared/CLAUDE.md; defines persona, repos, examples
├── mcp.json          # MCP servers to expose to this agent
└── subagents/        # optional persona-specific subagents (one .md per subagent)
    └── *.md
```

That is the entire contract. The image picks it up at build time; deploying a new agent is
adding the directory + a new `StatefulSet` referencing the same image with a different
`AGENT_NAME`.

### Shared settings (`agents/_shared/settings.json`)

The shared settings file is what makes runtime behaviour consistent across agents:

- **`enabledPlugins`** — `matrix@claude-code-channel-matrix` (Matrix channel) and
  `superpowers@claude-plugins-official` (skill framework).
- **`permissions.defaultMode: "auto"`** with a tight allowlist (`Bash(git*)`, `Bash(gh*)`,
  read-only `kubectl` and `flux`, plus filesystem tools) and explicit denies for
  `kubectl delete*` and `git push origin main*`.
- **`hooks.UserPromptSubmit`** — injects a verbosity reminder before every reply so Matrix
  output stays short.
- **`hooks.Stop`** — runs `scripts/check-pr-comments.sh` with `asyncRewake: true`; an exit
  code of `2` rewakes the agent with the rewake message so PR comments don't sit unanswered.

---

## Security — iron-proxy

All agent egress runs through **iron-proxy** at ClusterIP `10.43.100.100`. This is the
**egress credential firewall**: agents hold only worthless proxy tokens, and iron-proxy
swaps real secrets in at the network boundary. A leaked agent token is worthless outside
the cluster.

- Agents carry `proxy-token-github` and `proxy-token-claude` — literal placeholder
  strings, never the real GitHub PAT or Claude OAuth token.
- iron-proxy MITMs all HTTPS egress, enforces a default-deny domain allowlist, and
  rewrites `Authorization` headers with the real credentials scoped to each host.
- Agent DNS is pointed at iron-proxy (`dnsPolicy: None`). In-cluster names
  (`*.cluster.local`) pass through to CoreDNS so NATS and the Matrix homeserver still
  resolve normally.
- The iron-proxy CA cert is distributed to agent pods via ExternalSecret. `setup.sh`
  installs it into the system trust store with `update-ca-certificates` so `git`, `gh`,
  and `curl` trust the MITM; the Dockerfile sets `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` so the Node-based
  `claude` CLI does too.

The agent code itself is unaware of any of this — it sends `Authorization:
Bearer proxy-token-github`, iron-proxy turns it into a real PAT, the target site sees a
normal request. The blast radius of a compromised agent pod is therefore "what can be done
through the allowlist" rather than "all of the homelab owner's accounts".

---

## Deployment

The agent runs in the homelab's `agents` namespace as a `StatefulSet` (one per agent) with:

- a PVC at `/root` for the assembled `~/.claude/` and persistent state,
- an init container running `scripts/setup.sh` to populate `/root` and `/workspace`,
- the main container running `scripts/entrypoint.sh` to start tmux,
- env vars sourced from an `ExternalSecret` backed by Infisical,
- `dnsPolicy: None` with `dnsConfig.nameservers: [10.43.100.100]` to route through iron-proxy.

Manifests live in
[`sherodtaylor/homelab/k8s/apps/agent-swarm/`](https://github.com/sherodtaylor/homelab/tree/main/k8s/apps/agent-swarm).
Reconciliation is via Flux; rolling the image is `flux reconcile kustomization agent-swarm`.

---

## Operations

### Attach to a running agent

Both tmux panes are recoverable from a shell on the pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n agents <agent>-0 -- tmux attach -t main
# Ctrl-b o  toggles between pane 0 (channels) and pane 1 (remote-control)
# Ctrl-b d  detaches without killing anything
```

Pane 0 is read-only in spirit — typing into it is fine, but the Matrix plugin is the
source of truth for prompts. Pane 1 is yours: a normal `claude --remote-control` session
that can also be claimed by the Claude desktop/web app once `SWARM_CLAUDE_CREDENTIALS` is
provisioned.

### Build the image locally

```bash
docker build -t agent-swarm:local .
```

The Dockerfile is multi-stage: stage 1 builds [`mcp-nats`](https://github.com/sinadarbouy/mcp-nats)
from source (Go 1.25+), stage 2 produces the runtime image (Debian + `gh`, `kubectl`,
Node.js + Claude Code CLI, Bun for the channel plugin, the mcp-nats binary).

### CI / image publishing

`.github/workflows/docker.yml` builds and pushes
`ghcr.io/sherodtaylor/agent-swarm:latest` on every push to `main`. There is no separate
tagging strategy yet — the homelab pod always tracks `latest`.

### Logs

Pane output is teed to PID 1's stdout (`tmux pipe-pane … cat >> /proc/1/fd/1`), so
`kubectl logs` on either container shows both the setup output and the live tmux content.
VictoriaLogs in the cluster captures the full stream.

### Inspect a Matrix sender allowlist

```bash
cat ~/.claude/channels/matrix/access.json
```

To change it, update `MATRIX_ALLOWED_USERS` in Infisical and restart the pod — `setup.sh`
regenerates the file on init.

---

## Agent behaviour

The behavioural contract lives in [`agents/_shared/CLAUDE.md`](agents/_shared/CLAUDE.md)
and the per-agent files. Highlights worth knowing when you watch the bots work:

- **Response triggers.** A bot responds when (a) its name appears in the message, (b) the
  sender is `@sherod:lab.sherodtaylor.dev`, or (c) the message is a threaded reply to
  something the bot said. All other messages get a `👀` reaction and silence.
- **Loop prevention.** Agents never reply to each other unless directly named; max three
  consecutive messages per room without a human in between.
- **Cross-agent PR review.** After opening a PR, the author publishes
  `swarm.events.pr_opened` to NATS and mentions every other teammate by full Matrix ID in
  `#dev`. Mentioned agents read the diff, run the `code-review` skill with `--comment` to
  post inline findings, and post a one-line summary.
- **Autonomous PR follow-up.** The `check-pr-comments.sh` Stop hook rewakes the author on
  unaddressed review comments; the agent addresses or replies to each, then posts a
  one-liner in `#dev`.
- **Secret handling.** Agents are forbidden from echoing, logging, or returning secret
  values in Matrix replies. Generated secrets are written directly to their destination.

For the full set of rules see `agents/_shared/CLAUDE.md`; for per-agent behaviour see
`agents/infrabot/CLAUDE.md` and `agents/devbot/CLAUDE.md`.

## Adding a new agent

1. Create `agents/<name>/` with `CLAUDE.md`, `mcp.json`, and an optional `subagents/` dir.
   Use an existing agent as a template — match the section structure.
2. Build and push the image (CI does this automatically on merge to `main`).
3. Provision Matrix credentials for the new bot user in Infisical (`MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN`,
   `MATRIX_BOT_USER_ID`).
4. Add the new `StatefulSet` in `sherodtaylor/homelab/k8s/apps/agent-swarm/` referencing the
   same image with the new `AGENT_NAME` and the right `AGENT_REPOS`.
5. Reconcile Flux. The pod comes up, joins Matrix, and is ready to be tagged in `#dev` or
   `#infra`.

The shared base rules (`agents/_shared/CLAUDE.md`) automatically include the new agent in
the cross-agent PR review fan-out — no per-agent code change required, the rules read the
**Your Team** list at runtime.
